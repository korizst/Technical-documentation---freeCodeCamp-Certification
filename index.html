                At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces
                of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted
                list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a
                header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and
                videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental 
                concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the
                web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML 
                consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content 
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to 
                connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.

                    The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), 
                    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins 
                    or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
                </li>

                    the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common 
                    beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

                The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. 
                It contains information such as the page title, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content 
                with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and 
                important keywords that describe the document). Web browsers use information contained in the head to 
                render the HTML document correctly. In this article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order 
                to give you a good basis for working with markup.

                The HTML head is the contents of the &lt;head&gt; element. Unlike the contents of the &lt;body&gt; element (which are displayed 
                on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job 
                is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, the head is quite small. In larger pages however, the head can
                get quite large.

            <p class="main-section--description">
                We've already seen the &lt;title&gt; element in action — this can be used to add a title to the document. This however 
                can get confused with the h1 element, which is used to add a top level heading to your body content — this 
                is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things! The h1 element appears on the page 
                when loaded in the browser — generally this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content 
                (the story title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage.) The &lt;title&gt; element is metadata that 
                represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.)

                One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer 
                intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, 
                emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.
            </p>
            <h3 class="main-section--inner-heading">The basics: headings and paragraphs</h3>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college 
                textbook, a magazine, etc. Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable. In HTML, each
                paragraph has to be wrapped in a &lt;p&gt; element, like so:
            </p>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                <code>
                    &lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.&lt;/p&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:
            </p>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;I am the title of the story.&lt;/h1&gt;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each element represents a different level of content in 
                the document; &lt;h1&gt; represents the main heading, &lt;h2&gt; represents subheadings, &lt;h3&gt; represents sub-subheadings, 
                and so on.

            <p class="main-section--description">
                Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since 
                the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or 
                resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content 
                can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).

            <h3 class="main-section--inner-heading">Anatomy of a link</h3>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an &lt;a&gt; element and using the href attribute,
                also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
            </p>

                Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, 
                unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly 
                structured:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">header:</span> Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline.
                    This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
                </li>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">navigation bar:</span> Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, 
                    or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having
                    inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider 
                    the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in 
                    fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the 
                    two features better if they are separate.
                </li>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">main content:</span> A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content 
                    of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the 
                    map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will 
                    vary from page to page!
                </li>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">sidebar:</span> Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to 
                    what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's 
                    bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a 
                    secondary navigation system.
                </li>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">footer:</span> A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, 
                    copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that 
                    information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO 
                    purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="main-section--inner-heading">HTML fot structuring content</h3>
            <p class="main-section--description">
                Some websites have more columns, some are a lot more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could 
                use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as 
                discussed before, we need to respect semantics and use the right element for the right job. This is because visuals 
                don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts 
                of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for example, 
                who might not find concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful? In your HTML code, you can mark up sections 
                of content based on their functionality — you can use elements that represent the sections of content described 
                above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screen readers can recognize those elements and help with 
                tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides 
                dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">header:</span> <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.

                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">navigation bar:</span> <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>.
                </li>
                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">main content:</span> <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, with various content subsections represented by
                    <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements.
                </li>

                    <span class="bold">sidebar:</span> <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>; often placed inside <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>.

                <li class="description-list">
                    <span class="bold">footer:</span> <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.
